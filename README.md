# Cranfield Data Analyzer

Information retrieval experiments with the Cranfield dataset using various weighting schemes.

## Overview

This project implements and experiments with different term weighting schemes for information retrieval, using the classic Cranfield dataset and TREC evaluation methodology.

## Features

- Parse Cranfield and TREC format documents
- Implement various weighting schemes (TF-IDF, BM25, etc.)
- Evaluate retrieval effectiveness

## Dataset

The [Cranfield collection](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cran/) is a classic information retrieval test collection containing 1,400 aeronautics abstracts.

## Technologies

- Java
- Information Retrieval algorithms
- TREC evaluation tools

## Use Cases

- IR algorithm experimentation
- Weighting scheme comparison
- Academic research in information retrieval
